# scripts

The Scripts in this folder should go in a Blob Storage Account which you have credentials for. I put them in a Container called scripts. 

These scripts will be downloaded in a CustomScriptExtension task via their URI's and are responsible for performing the actual onboarding to Azure Automation DSC.  
`        "fileUris": [
          "https://[storage_account_name].blob.core.windows.net/scripts/DscMetaConfigs.ps1",
          "https://[storage_account_name].blob.core.windows.net/scripts/Execute_DscScripts.ps1"
        ]
